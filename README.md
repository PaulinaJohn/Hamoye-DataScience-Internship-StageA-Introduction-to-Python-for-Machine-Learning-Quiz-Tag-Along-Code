In this notebook, I documented my Quiz tag-along code for stage A- **Introduction to Python for Machine Learning- of the Hamoye Data Science Internship**.

The task involved exploring a dataset, provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), to answer specific questions. 

I accessed the dataset via Hamoye's Github page.
